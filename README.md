# Recursion-Practice

**Objective**

I am completing two assignments to help myself learn recursion.

Assignment 1: 

1. Using iteration, I practiced writing a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.

2. I practiced writing another function which solves the same problem recursively.

Assignment 2:

1. I practiced building a function that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
